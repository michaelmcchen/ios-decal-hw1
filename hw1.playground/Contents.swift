//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: both values are of type String optional. The only difference is that the instance values are forcibly unwrapped. Thus, if wordA or wordB is nil, there will be a runtime exception.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    static func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The compiler dislikes the for loop because is is declared with the "let" keyword, which implies that i is a constant. Thus, i cannot be incremented using "i++". We can fix it by changing "let" to "var." Furthermore, numElements can be declared as "let" instead of as "var" as the value never changes. The function can be declared as static because it's being called by instances of another class. Finally, the function needs to return true at the very end to fulfill the function return type (boolean - it needs both true and false cases depending on if the inputs are palindromes or not).


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: To declare countLetters, the colon needs to be replaced by equals sign and the parenthesises are required for initailization. Furthermore, the the class declaration needs to be removed as this isn't a class. We can change the var keywords to "let" in the delcaration of lenA and lenB as these values do not change for the entireity of the function. Finally, I substitute "_" for letter in (letter, count) in the final for loop as the "letter" immutable variable is never used. I also return true at the end to satisfy the function declaration of boolean.
